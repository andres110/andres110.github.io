<header><h3><em> More random stuff about me</em></h3></header>
<p> I do listen to a lot of music during my free time. Whenever I am on the internet I usually go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube.</a> I mean I don't like staying inside a lot. I enjoy exploring new places. even if it is a new route I enjoy doing something different. I have een swimming for several years now. I started around 3rd gade and throughout the years I have progess into a better swimmer.I enjoy the most being with my friend Nic. We have been really close friends since kindergarden. My favorite word is wack for some reason. I dunno I just liek saying wack.I waste way too much time on my phone which is very bad. I lowkey have an addiction to it but it is like  I know it's there so it is chill. My favorite colors are Orange, Light green, and purple.</P>
